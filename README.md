This program is a comprehensive tool for processing and analyzing text files, particularly focused on dictionary management and word validation. Its functionalities span across reading and processing dictionary files, traversing directories to find text files, managing words and their occurrences in texts, and validating words against a loaded dictionary. The program also provides custom string comparison functions that respect ASCII characters and offer both case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparisons.

Functionalities and Workflow
Dictionary Preparation (DYprepare): This function dynamically allocates memory for storing words from a dictionary file. It reads each word from the file and stores it in a global 2D array (words), resizing the array as needed to accommodate all words. This is crucial for the program's ability to check text files against the dictionary content.

Custom String Comparison (my_strcmp, my_NCSstrcmp): The program includes two custom string comparison functions to cater to different needs. my_strcmp performs a case-sensitive comparison, skipping over apostrophes and non-ASCII characters. my_NCSstrcmp does the same but in a case-insensitive manner. These functions are essential for searching within the dictionary, considering the variability in word casing and special characters.

Binary and Sequential Searches (CSbinarySearch, NCSbinarySearch, NCSseqSearch): These functions implement binary and sequential search algorithms for case-sensitive and case-insensitive word lookups in the dictionary. They leverage the custom comparison functions to efficiently find words, supporting the program's validation mechanism.

Word Processing (process_word): This function is designed for adding words to the global dictionary array, though it's noted as defunct in favor of dynamic allocation methods in DYprepare.

Word Validation (DOcheckL): This function checks if a given word exists in the dictionary, using both case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches. It validates words found in text files against the dictionary, handling different case forms to ensure accurate validation.

Linked List Management (append, checkList): These functions manage a linked list that stores information about each word found in text files, including its presence of hyphens, line and word numbers, and the filename. append adds words to the list, while checkList traverses the list, checking each word against the dictionary and printing words that fail validation.

File and Directory Processing (comparePrepare, traverseDirectory, processIndividualFile): comparePrepare processes a single text file, reading words, and managing a linked list of words for validation. traverseDirectory recursively traverses directories to find and process .txt files (or all files if in dictionary mode). processIndividualFile serves as an entry point for processing files based on command-line arguments, distinguishing between dictionary and text files.

Utility Functions (clearSurround, capFL, ttl_upper, ttl_lower): These functions provide additional string manipulation capabilities, such as clearing punctuation or digits from around words, capitalizing the first letter of a string, and counting uppercase or lowercase letters in a word.

Output and Working Mechanism
The program's output consists primarily of words from text files that either do not exist in the loaded dictionary or fail the case variation checks. Each output line includes the filename, line number, word number, and the word itself, providing a clear context for each validation failure. This output is generated by the checkList function after all text files have been processed.

Limitations
The only problem that we had was that the code would not separate the hyphens correctly all the time. Approximately: 80% success rate.

The code's workflow begins with loading the dictionary and then processing each text file found either directly through command-line arguments or by traversing specified directories. Each word is analyzed for its conformity to the dictionary, with special considerations for hyphenated words and case variations. The program efficiently manages memory for the dynamically growing dictionary and utilizes data structures like linked lists to keep track of words and their occurrences in files.

In essence, this program combines file I/O operations, string manipulation, data structure management, and algorithmic searches to provide a robust tool for text file analysis and dictionary validation. Its design reflects a well-thought-out approach to handling real-world text processing challenges, such as dealing with large dictionaries, varying file structures, and the complexities of natural language text.
